## **üîßDesign thinking**
## **Empathy Phase**
The first phase of a Design Thinking process is empathizing. As we have mentioned, this innovation tool is user-centric. And it is used to offer solutions to people's specific wants or needs. When designing for others, the first step will be to put ourselves in their shoes, to understand what is truly relevant to them. The more capable we are of putting ourselves in their place, the more facilities we will have to understand them and identify what can genuinely add value to them.

### **What, how, why?**
Method that helps to deepen the observation to more abstract emotions and other motivations that happen in a certain situation.

- **What**: What are they doing there?
- **How**: How are they doing it?
- **Why**: we will try to guess why they are doing it that way.

### **Applying it to the case study "Courses and certifications"**
**What?**

- They are taking courses.

**How?**

- Through an electronic platform.

**Why?**
- Learning and curricular value.

### **Cognitive immersion.**
It is one of the most powerful techniques that you can use in a Design Thinking process, being useful at the beginning, which is situated within the process of the first empathy phase, which will help us understand the processes of services and products in a more complete way. In order to achieve the same experience that a user lives in a specific situation, being able to connect with the needs and desires that are most relevant to them.

|Acosta Noriega Saul Eduardo|In order to carry out the research we relied on the case study, as well as it was a great challenge to know which tools to use since each one said different tools but in the end we were able to decide on some in order to carry out this project. Some of the problems we had was when asking the questions since we elaborated them badly but with the feedback they gave us, it was possible to carry out and we were able to answer them.
|Garza Aguilar Sergio Alberto|Design thinking is made up of several stages in the development of this case study, we will be able to explore various phases for the development of the system, in this first stage "Empathize" we were able to collect data by means of an interview simulating field work. It allowed us to experience what the collection of information from a client is like, this activity in a certain way begins to conform to the client's needs with the case study model proposed by us and we begin to adapt both to move forward.
|Hern√°ndez Fern√°ndez Diana|It was an experience that left me a great learning to how we were developing what we were asked to do in this way we managed to get to know and examine each of the tools both those that were presented to us and those that we are looking for on our part to apply them according to our use case "Courses and Certifications". The problem that there was when performing the activity was almost at the end when choosing the tool that each one considered correct since we thought very differently until we finally reached an agreement.
|Zazueta Lopez Diana|Our case study, courses and certifications, was the basis to develop everything that is in this activity since we had to analyze its characteristics in a very detailed way to prepare the interview and not miss any details to be able to get From then on the requirements or functions of the system, it was a challenge for the team since we did not understand some parts of the case study but it was possible to understand by talking and giving our points of view. And when we got to the part of the tools of empathizing as a team, we looked for and read several until we reached the point of choosing the one that best applies to courses and certifications. I got a good experience as I came across very good tools that I didn't know existed.|
