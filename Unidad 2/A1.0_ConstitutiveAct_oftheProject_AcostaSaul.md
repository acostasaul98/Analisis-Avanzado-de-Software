| **Integrants** | **Conclusion** |
| --- | --- |
| Acosta Noriega Saul Eduardo | This document will help us to establish in a more formal way the organization of the project, because with this document we will know who must do everything and at what time it should be done. As it was, this document is the legal basis for our project.
| Garza Aguilar Sergio Alberto |Moving forward with the project we reach the stage where we can consolidate all the requirements to be able to translate them and turn them into a formal document where it is explained in detail what type of system as well as its functions, as developers it is important to be clear about what we are going to work on now. We must avoid the possibility of disagreements regarding the delivery of the product, in turn, as a team, we are responsible for the times in which we will work and the resources that will be necessary to be able to consolidate the platform.
| Hern√°ndez Fern√°ndez Diana | Finally, the constitutive act was developed according to the case study "courses and certifications", in the first place each one of the acts carried out was analyzed in order to arrive at a single one that will be the one that represents the project, the different ideas of each one of the team members joined. Some were discarded and others were supplemented according to the new ideas that were reached at the end, managing to capture the important information of the project to generate development and be able to conclude it successfully.
| Zazueta Lopez Diana | When making this document in which all the general and basic aspects of the company are stipulated, I could see the importance of this since personally it helped me to centralize everything regarding the project and clarify my ideas to start with everything that comes ahead. |
