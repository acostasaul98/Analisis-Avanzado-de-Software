|Acosta Noriega Saul Eduardo|As a conclusion, the architecture design should be an iterative process (implement, test and measure), in order to mitigate risks related to the architecture and help to understand the requirements. In this case, we believe that the architecture presented in this document must be iterated in order to detect potential improvements to the exposed solutions.
|Garza Aguilar Sergio Alberto|The design patterns are the pillar in the platform architecture, since the programmed objects are used and they are given a functional form, the data must be used in a functional way according to what the system requires, based on The following design patterns have been selected to shape the case study courses and certifications. Choosing a suitable architecture is essential because we can detect possible errors and it saves us time working in the code development processes knowing in which direction we have to focus.
|Hernández Fernández Diana|The architecture patterns were generated according to the UML generated and guiding us with the instructions raised by the advisor, managing to apply it to the case study "courses and certifications" offering solutions to software architecture problems that may arise during its development by specifying a predefined set of subsystems with their responsibilities and a series of recommendations to organize the different components.
|Zazueta Lopez Diana|By doing this work for our software for courses and certifications, I was able to realize the importance of the architecture of systems and applications since it is vital for their operation since architecture is the one who designs from the structure of your data to the algorithms.|
